## Overview

This is my solution to the QR Code Component challenge on Frontend Mentor

## My process

Basically, I just toyed around until it worked

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This project helped me practice my flexbox, positioning, and a little bit of grid.

### Continued development

I want to develop my overall css skills, such as positioning ETC.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me by providing a clear understanding of Flexbox
